This project was cool, the maze setup used was just a 3x3 box of carboard as seen in the image, there were two paths that the car could be stuck in. 

Constructing the car was very hard because of some faulty components, additionally, getting the car to actually travel the right distance was pretty hard. 
The recursive strategy used was to visit each cell based on the starting orientation of the car, and then go back if there were no moves to go.
